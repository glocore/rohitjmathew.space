# rohitjmathew.space

My portfolio has transformed over the years - from a static Bootstrap HTML site, to Gatsby, and finally to Next.js/React/MDX. 

My personal slice of the internet provides a platform for me to showcase my personal brand and latest work.

Thanks to [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob) for his amazing website being my inspiration and the code repo which helped me build this site.
