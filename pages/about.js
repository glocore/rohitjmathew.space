            Hey, I&apos;m Rohit. I&apos;m a developer, writer, musician, football fan and just a naturally curious person in life.
            I work at McAfee as a SDE on their enterprise platform team working on building SecOps products. I&apos;m also a 
            Auth0 Ambassador working on sharing knowledge, tips, and best practices on topics relating to identity, security, 
            and authentication.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have previously worked on building a reliable product for agents to sell insurance at Turtlemint 
            and helped them scale 50x from 20k insurance agents to 1 million + insurance agents and a growing SaaS business.
            I have done 7 internships during my undergraduate education culminating with my intership at HackerRank
          </p>
          <p>
          If I&apos;m not coding, I am generally:
          <ul>
            <li>Staying up to date with the latest technological developments</li>
            <li>Binging Spotify playlists to find new unheard of artists</li>
            <li>Going for Gigs and Music Festivals</li>
            <li>Playing/Watching Football</li>
